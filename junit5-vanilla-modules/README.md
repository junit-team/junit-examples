# junit5-vanilla-modules

The project layout structure and command line tools usages are based on proposals
introduced by the [**Module System Quick-Start Guide**](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/quick-start).

This sample project does not aim to demonstrate how to use the JUnit Platform APIs.
For detailed  information on the JUnit Platform programming and extension models,
please consult the [User Guide](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/).
